        <p id="bio">
            I’m a multidisciplinary artist with over 25 years in NY theater as a creator, designer, and performer.<br>
            My work exists in the space where live meets digital; ultimately performative but expressively intermedia.<br> 
            Engaging video as light, as context, as collaborator, I create intermedia art that merges theater and gallery<br>
            and cinema spaces to confront issues of transnational and transcultural identity.<br> 
            My foundation in live performance leads me to value the interactivity of sharing space with an audience,<br>
            in the empathy and complicity of the shared experience.<br> 
            My approach embraces collaboration of ideas, of forms, of selves to manifest that collective experience.
